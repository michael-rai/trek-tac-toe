Planning for this this project began on Thursday, October 25. It was conceptualized this would be a Star Trek themed tic-tac-toe game titled: "Trek-Tac-Toe". The user will be prompted to create a login using an email and password, then they must chose an affiliation--The Federation or Klingon Empire. That choice will be assigned to the user as "X", while the opposite is "O".

At this time, we are currently in planning stages known as "Iteration 0".

//Will update later with problem-solving strategies as they arise

By Iteration H or deployment, we will have an MVP of a fully functional tic-tac-toe game.
